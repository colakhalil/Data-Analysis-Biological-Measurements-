Project Title
Data Analysis and Machine Learning on Biological Measurements Dataset

# Project Description
This project involves analyzing a dataset containing biological measurements and other attributes of various subjects (likely animals). The primary goal is to understand relationships within the data, preprocess it, and use machine learning techniques to draw meaningful insights. The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook includes steps for data loading, preprocessing, feature analysis, and model preparation.

# Dataset
The dataset, dataset.csv, consists of 3430 entries with 11 attributes, including species, island, various physical measurements (bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass), sex, diet, life stage, health metrics, and year of data collection.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, and other dependencies as listed in the notebook.
Installation
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

# Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook (Halil Ibrahim Umut-Colak-CS412-HW1.ipynb) in a Jupyter environment.
Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to understand the dataset, preprocess it, and perform data analysis.
You can modify or extend the analysis as per your requirements.

# Structure of the Notebook
Import Libraries: Essential libraries are imported.
Load Dataset: The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
Understanding and Preprocessing: The dataset is explored, and necessary preprocessing steps are applied.
Data Splitting: The data is split into training and testing sets.
Feature Analysis: Correlation and feature selection are conducted.

#Additional Notes
The dataset contains missing values in certain columns, which are handled as part of preprocessing.
The notebook also includes suggestions for feature enhancement and model accuracy improvement.
